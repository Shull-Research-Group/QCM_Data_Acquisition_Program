Installing MyVNA program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MyVNA program is a software that was devloped by the original harware
 designers of the N2PK Vector Network Analyzer (N2PK-VNA).
 This program directly manipulates the N2PK-VNA.
 For more information on the MyVNA program and the N2PK-VNA hardware setup,
 visit http://g8kbb.co.uk/html/myvna.html.
 Also, there is a small active community of radio-enthusiasts that constantly
 improve the software and harware design and capabilites of the N2PK-VNA.
 For more information on this community, visit https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups
/N2PK-VNA/info.

Installing AccessMyVNAv0.7 program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting up this program is easy.
 All that is required is to ensure that the folder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AccessMyVNAv0.7
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is in the same directory as the QCM MATLAB Program.
 For example, if the path directory to the QCM MATLAB Program is <C:
\backslash
Program Files (x86)
\backslash
QCM MATLAB Program>, make sure that <C:
\backslash
Program Files (x86)
\backslash
QCM MATLAB Program
\backslash
AccessMyVNAv0.7> exists.
 This folder contains the program, AccessMyVNA, that is important for the
 QCM MATLAB Program to (indirectly) manipulate the MyVNA program.
 Currently, the QCM MATLAB Program automatically executes the AccessMyVNA
 each time the QCM MATLAB Program initiates and creates the GUI figure.
 However, to manually execute the AccessMyVNA program, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AccessMyVNA.exe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file can be found in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

release
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder in the AccessMyVNAv0.7 folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure to install the necessary .dll files.

\series bold
 
\series default
To do this, simply run execution file located in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Visual C++ redistributable packages for visual basic 2013
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder.
 If the installation is being performed on a 32-bit computer, run the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vcredist_x86(1).exe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file.
 If the installation is being performed on a 64-bit computer, run the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vcredist_x64(1).exe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file.
 If an error message appears, (when executing the AccessMyVNA.exe file) stating
 that a .dll file is missing, try running both the 32-bit and 64-bit execution
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those running the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AccessMyVNAv0.7
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on Windows 8 or higher, make sure to change the compatability mode of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AccessMyVNAv0.7.exe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to Windows 7.
 Otherwise, the program will unexpectedly crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Note for code developers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the AccessMyVNAv0.7 folder, there are many other folders and files.
 These 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folders and files are needed if there is a need to edit the AccessMyVNAv0.7
 program code.
 To access this code, Visual Basic C++ (2013 or higher) must be installed.
 The file, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AccessMyVNA.sln
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, can be opened with Visual Basic C++ and the file, AccessMyVNADlg.cpp, can
 be accessed in the solution explorer panel.
 It is within the AccessMyVNADlg.cpp in which most of the important features
 and functions of the AccessMyVNAv0.7 is defined.
 Ideally, this program should be rewritten.
 However, rewriting this program requires advanced knowledge and experience
 in working with Visual Basic C++.
 In particular, this program relies on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MFC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Microsoft Foundation Class) libraries, which are only supported in Visual
 Basic Professional 2013 or higher (not the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Express
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version!).
 A free student license of Visual Basic Professional 2013 (or higher) can
 be obtained from Microsoft's Dreamspark program.

Choosing which harmonic to track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The N2PK-VNA impedance analyzer is capable of tracking up to 6 harmonics

Harmonics
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Spectra refresh resolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Settings Panel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 controls how often the QCM MATLAB Program refreshes the raw conductance
 and/or susceptance spectras.
 Its default value is 1, which means that the MATLAB program will refresh
 the spectras each time it reads in data from the datafile (see Part 2 for
 a more thorough explanation on how the QCM MATLAB Program reads data from
 the impedance analyzer).
 Changing this number to a higher integer-value can potentially increase
 the time resolution of the measurements significantly, since it takes a
 finite amount of time for MATLAB to constantly refresh the spectral plots.
 For example, a spectra refresh resolution of 10 means that the MATLAB prgram
 will refresh the plots every 10th measurement it collects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reference time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this programs collects frequency and dissipation shifts as a function
 of time, having a reference time is important, especially if new data needs
 to be appended onto another dataset from a previous experiment.
 The default reference time is set to the time in which the QCM MATLAB GUI
 figure was initiated.
 The reference time can also be changed manually by editting the values
 in the text box.
 Make sure that the values are in the correct format, yy:mm:dd:HH:MM:SS:FFF,
 where yy, mm, dd, MM, SS, and FFF, represent the last two digits of the
 year, the month, the day, the hour (24-hour format), the minutes, the seconds,
 and the milliseconds, respectively.

Time between harmonics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option controls the amount of time (in milliseconds) in between each
 harmonic measurements.
 In general, it is not neccesary to change this value.
 
\series bold
A short time can lead to synchronization and systematic errors.
 
\series default
If the resonance peaks in the spectra looks odd or abnormal, increasing
 the amount of time in between each harmonic measurement might solve the
 problem.
 Otherwise, it might be due to other errors (see the Troubleshooting section).
 An example of what a resonance peak looks like if there is not sufficient
 amount of time in between harmonics is shown in Figure

Number of datapoints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of datapoints in each frequency scan can be adjusted.
 The default value is 200 datapoints.
 Note that increasing the number of datapoints will require more time in
 between harmonics.
 Thus, the time in between haronics need to be adjusted accordingly.
 
\series bold
A good rule of thumb is to allow 4-6 ms for each datapoint.

 option
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time interval in which the QCM MATLAB Program records the spectra measure
 can be set in this option.
 For experiments that last for days to weeks, it is more practical to increase
 the time interval in which the MATLAB program records the data.
 Currently, the MATLAB program allows for 1 million timepoints to be recorded.
 If more than one million datapoints are collected, an error will appear
 and terminate the data collection process.
 The maximum number of datapoints to keep can be adjusted in the MATLAB
 code.
 However, it should be noted that the MATLAB program will progressively
 slow down as more data is being collected since it will take longer for
 MATLAB to append new values and variables into the output 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.mat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 files.
 For all practical purposes, this should not be an issue.
 If it is an issue, the output files should be split up into multiple files
 to mitigate this effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For experiments that are on a short time scale, it is important to remember
 that the number of datapoints and time in between harmonics need to be
 adjusted accordingly before decreasing the recording time interval.
 Otherwise, duplicates of the same spectra will be recorded.
 
\series bold
In other words, if the recording time interval is less than the time in
 between harmonics, duplicates of the same spectra will be recorded.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This functionality is particularly useful when an outlier (due to poor fitting,

 graphical interpretation of the measurement proccess difficult.
 This function is NOT to be used for data manipulation!

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Load bare crystal data 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/bare.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since frequency and dissipation shifts are relative to a reference value,
 the reference values, which are typically values measured using a bare
 crystal, can be loaded.
 The default reference values correspond to theoretical resonance frequencies
 (5, 15, 25, etc.
 MHz) and an arbitrary dissipation value of 100 Hz.
 Clicking on this button will bring up a windows file explorer dialogue,
 asking to load the reference crystal data file, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<reference filename>.mat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This data file has the same format and data structure as a typical QCM
 file (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Designated-output-filename"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The program reads in the reference crystal data file and computes the average
 of the entire frequency and dissipation dataset for each harmonic.
 The average values are then used to replace the default reference values.
 The frequency and dissipation shifts measured will be adjusted accordingly.
 The plots in the main plot panel might need to be refreshed in order to
 see the changes made to the reference values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 mode.
 This button allows the user to load raw spectra data files and refit the

 A window file explorer dialogue will appear asking for a raw spectra file,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<filename>_raw_spectra.mat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The program effectively treats the raw spectras as measurements obtained
 from the MyVNA program.
 Thus, all fitting options related to multi-peak fitting and different guess
 values will be avaialble.
 This is useful when frequency and dissipation shifts are lost and need
 to be recovered.
 Also, for situations where the measurement process used a sub-optimal single-pe
ak fitting algorithm to characterizing overlapping resonance peaks, this
 functionality allows the user to post-fit the collected data in order to
 obtain a more accurate and precise values for the frequency and dissipation
 values.

 The first column contains the harmonic order the parameters are associated.
 The second column contains the peak prominence sensitivity factor associated
 with the peak identification prcoess (a lower number corresponds to higher
 peak sensitivity); the values must be between 0 and 1.
 The third column contains parameters associated with the minimum peak height
 requirement relative to the datapoint with the highest y-value in the spectra
 (a lower number corresponds to higher peak sensitivity); the values must
 be between 0 and 1.
 The fourth column contains the maximum number of peaks the program will
 search in the resonance spectra; values must be between 1 and 3 (the maximum
 number of peaks is set to 3).

 The

 are being recorded (since there are more

 Thus, it is advisable to clear out the QCM_diary.txt file ever once in awhile
 during a long measurement process with short measurement intervals.
 Also, if the

\begin_layout Section
Goal and purpose of the QCM MATLAB program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal for the developement of this program is to provide a MATLAB
 interface in obtaining QCM measurements.
 Specifically, this program has the capability to measure the location and
 half-max-half-width (HMHW) of the resonance conductance peaks.
 Based on this information, analysis can be performed (in MATLAB) on these
 measurements to extract out the viscoelastic properties of a film deposited
 on the QCM crystal.
 Currently, error bars are not explicitly calculated (only 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

values for the peak fitting is calculated); however, one can easily calculate
 error statistics since all of the raw conductance/susceptance spectra data
 is saved in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Section
Hardware and software components

\begin_layout Subsection
Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hardware required to run the program is the N2PK Vector Network Analyzer
 (N2PK-VNA, an impedance analyzer custom built by Ivan Markarov), a crystal
 holder (Inficon, NY), and a QCM crystal (Inficon, NY).
 Further information on the N2PK-VNA hardware details can be found in http://g8k
bb.co.uk/html/myvna.html.
 An image of the setup can be seen in Figure

\begin_layout Subsection
Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The N2PK-VNA came with a proprietary software called myVNA.
 This software allows for remote access, which provides a means to control
 the N2PK-VNA hardware with a custom program.
 Currently, the program called AccessMyVNA (written in VB C++) is used to
 remote-access the impedance analyzer.
 AccessMyVNA is designed as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middleman
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gateway
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program for the QCM MATLAB program to communicate with the N2PK-VNA hardware.
 Details on how the programs communicate with each other is discussed in
 subsequent sections.
 To summarize, in order to collect QCM measurements with the QCM MATLAB
 program, three programs must be runnning simultaneously: 1) MyVNA, 2) AccessMyV
NA, 3) QCM MATLAB program.
 An image if each program is shown in Figure

, the QCM MATLAB Program does not directly communicate with the impedance
 analyzer, instead the MATLAB program directly manipulates AccessMyVNA to
 control the impedance analyzer.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the program heavily relies on the details on how the measurement process
 is run, a section has been dedicated in explaining how the MATLAB script
 was written.
 When an unforseen error or bug occurs, this section is a good place in
 finding the origin of the problem.

This program is heavily influenced by the many features in the QTZ.exe written
 by Diethelm Johannsmann, Institute of Physical Chemistry, TU-Clausthal,
 Germany.
 The author of this MATLAB program is very thankful for his contribution
 to the QCM community and theory.
 Further, many thanks to the members of the Shull Research Group, Northwestern
 University, and Professor Kenneth Shull for his guidance and design into
 the developement of this QCM MATLAB program.
 Any comments or suggestions are welcome! CHJoshuaYeh@u.northwestern.edu
